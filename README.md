# More Than A Calculator
New C++ Calculator



#History of Software
It was structed and completed in a month and a half, documentated wih Dev C++ classic comments to 
facilitate the user to understand the code and versioned with Git (upload project in GitHub) where
you can read the modifies made as code taking shape.



#What can it do?
This software was been created to resolve math operations in a simple graphic Calculator,
iit can resolve simple linear operation, radiant and gradiant operation,
power elevations, exponential and logarithmic operations.
It can also interacts with files, user can choose to save or delete a documentation (.doc or .txt file),
can choose to save math operations in a .txt file called result.txt and can choose to make a backup
of operation in a file called backup.txt (backup.txt also contains the time of exit from the program).



#Program Language
It was created in C++ code, with integration of self-classes made in C++ too (.h), one of which 
integrates Classic C code.



#Ascii Art
Our Information Technology teacher Ivano Mazzarotto has suggested us the idea of graphic display, 
some .txt file that we have created draw the plan into Dev C++ display, giving a graphic touch to the 
Software.
